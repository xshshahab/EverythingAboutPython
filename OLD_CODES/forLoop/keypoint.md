# Key Points:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum sum of a subarray within a given array.

## \*. Syntax:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Do something
```

2. You can loop through:

- Lists, tuples, or other collections.
- Strings (loop through characters).
- Numbers using `range()`.
