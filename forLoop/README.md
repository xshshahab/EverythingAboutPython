# For Loop in Python

A **for loop** in Python is used to repeat a block of code for every item in a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It's like saying, "Do this thing for every item in this group."

## Example 1: Loop through a list

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### output :

```python
apple
banana
cherry
```

## Example 2: Loop through a range of numbers

```python
for num in range(5):
    print(num)
```

### output :

```python
0
1
2
3
4
```
