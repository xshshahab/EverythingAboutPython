# What are strings in python?

- Strings in Python are sequences of characters. They can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes. Strings are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, it cannot be changed.

### Example

```python
s = 'Hello, World!'
print(s)  # Outputs: Hello, World!
s = "Hello, World!"
print(s)  # Outputs: Hello, World!
```

## What are the different types of strings in Python?

- There are two main types of strings in Python: strings and bytes.

### Strings

Strings are sequences of Unicode characters. They can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes.

### Bytes

Bytes are sequences of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. They are used to
represent raw binary data.
